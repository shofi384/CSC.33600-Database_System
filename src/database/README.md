# To configure database connectivity on local machine  
Have MySQL installed  
Run 'mysqld' command to run the server  
Run 'mysql -u root -p' to access DBMS as root user  
Run "CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';" to create a DBMS user  
Now, in mysql environment, run "CREATE DATABASE dbname"  to create a database  
Run "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbname.* TO 'username'@'localhost';" to grant user access to the database dbname  
> Now, log out and log in as the new created user: run mysql -u username -p  
Run a sql script as "mysql -u username -p < script.sql"  
Or alternatively from MySQL environment "source ../createSchemas.sql"
and . . . play around, we have all the scripts needed!
