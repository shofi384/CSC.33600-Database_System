# To Run from Cloning:
Have Node.js/npm installed on host machine  
Also have MySQL DBMS installed  
Or if preferred, customize the config file to use a different DBMS dialect  
Run the app with the following commands:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cd ./QuizeBase  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ npm install  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ npm start  


# Instruction: Build from Scratch  
Assuming the node/npm and MySQL installed on local machine  
(followed from here https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ npm init react-app quizbase  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ cd quizbase  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ npm start  
> $ npm test	// Runs tests related to files changed since the last commit  
  $ npm Build	// Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance
